My name is Muhammad Sami and I graduated from California State University, Beach with MS degree in Electrical Engineering in May,2020. My area of specialization includes Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, Image Processing and Communications. During my Master's program I was doing reserach in Network and Embedded System's Laboratory under supervision of Dr. Mohammad Mozumdar in area of Artificial Intelligence. I developed an Intrusion detection System to detect anomalies in Controller Area Network (CAN) bus using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms with extremely low false positives and over 99% accuracy.

I did my undergrad in Electronics Engineering from NED University of Engineering & Technology in 2014. After my undergrad I was working as Medical System Engineer where my responsibilities were to Install and Commission Medical Imaging Equipment. I was the lead cyclotron engineer for ABT's cyclotron in Pakistan. I also got my certification as Front Line Service Engineer from ABT Molecular Imaging Inc. (now known as Best ABT). I designed and developed a new service manual for Cyclotron System which helps in optimizing uptime from 80% to 98% and maintained it for 2 years along with savings of $0.15 million in lieu of service contract with the manufacturing company. Moreover, I also trained a team of 5 cyclotron operators and on-site engineers on behalf of ABT Molecular Imaging, Inc. 

Apart from working on cyclotron I also installed and commissioned MRI, Digital Radiography, Angiography, and CT equipment of various manufacturers including Philips and GE. I also lead the technical team to secure Pakistanâ€™s first-ever Liver Dialysis contract worth $0.4 million.
